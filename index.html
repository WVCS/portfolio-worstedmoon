        <p class="earlyp">
          Back in 2004, March 31st, I was born in my hometown of San Diego. Of course, like any other baby, I was an absolute mess, however, I did kind of have a yellowish hue to my skin for the first few days of my life. As time went on, and I grew bigger, I was forced to attend several preschools, most of which I have forgoten the name of. The only one I remember was at Creekside Elementary, with one of the best teachers that I ever knew. When I was quite young, back in first grade, we moved from south of my current house, to of course, my new house.

          Throughout Elementary school, as mentoned before, in the middle of my first grade year, we moved to Adobe Bluffs. Here, I went through many teachers, most of which, I really liked, but then there were a few I hated. I do not remember much of my First or Second Grade teacher, but my third grade teacher was one of the best. Although we were required to do a lot of presentations, there was a good reason. Next, my fourth grade teacher is still my most hated one. She marked me down for random stuff, such as talking before class began. 5th grade went well, and I started play trumpet.

          My three years of Middle School were spent at Mesa Verde Middle School, where I had the same teacher for 2 years. The PE program was fun, and I loved band. My band teacher was the absolute best. It was here, at Mesa Verde, where I fist started working in food service. Throughout the majoirty of middle school, I just sat through it and did enough.

          Throughout my life, I attended many schools. I had numerous preschools, the vast majoirty of such, I am unable to remember. This list contains the school, what grades I was there for, and the years I was there for.

          Unfornuately, I have deleted practically all of my projects, and this is the only one that I have currently. The majoirty of the early projects were extremely bad, and had really bad styling. As I went on, I got better, and this is what my projects look like now.
